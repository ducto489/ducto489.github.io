I’m Dustin Nguyen, an undergraduate Physics student at [VNUHCM - University of Science in Vietnam](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/). Alongside my studies, I’m a self-taught Machine Learning learner. Check out some of my fun [project](/projects/) about Physics and ML.

I'm passionate about exploring how machine learning can solve complex physics problems. Let's see how far the AI can bring us!

In my free time, I enjoy reading book, watching anime, and traveling. 

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations Feel free to reach out via email or Facebook!
