I'm Dustin Nguyen, an undergraduate Physics student at [VNUHCM - University of Science in Vietnam](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/), with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. While pursuing my degree, I've been diving into ML projects and working as a research assistant at Quantum Lab @ VNU-HCM, where I apply quantum machine learning to solve complex problems, blending my love for physics with the power of AI.

Beyond academics, I enjoy reading and traveling.

I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals, discuss ideas, and collaborate on exciting projects and contests. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or work together!
